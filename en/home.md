- **Yowu** is a backend developer from South Korea. He is working on the video commerce platform [Shopping Live](https://shoppinglive.naver.com) team serviced by [NAVER](https://navercorp.com/en), a web search engine company (like Google) in Korea.

- **Yowu** has various experiences in web/app service backend development and as a startup developer. He has experience in designing, developing, and operating production services using Node.js, Java, MySQL, Redis, AWS, Git, Linux, etc., and is always thinking about back-end architectures and patterns that are highly scalable and maintainable.

- When he was 9 years old, his mother bought him a Windows ME operating system PC with a Celeron CPU, and they became good friends. His first hack was to use the hack mage skill by modifying the in-memory hex code of the Westwood company's Nox game. The small experiences accumulated one by one led him to major in computer science at university, and after a few more years, he became an **ordinary developer**.

- **YOWU DEV WIKI** Most English documents were created using Google Translate or other tools. In fact, he doesn't speak English very well. 😭
