# Overview
Life Insurance is a type of insurance product that provides financial protection to the policyholder, or their family, in the event of death. It pays out a lump sum or regular payments to the policyholder's beneficiaries, typically in the event of death, but also in some cases when the policyholder becomes disabled or critically ill.

# Description
Life insurance is a contract between an insurer and a policyholder, in which the insurer agrees to pay out a sum of money to the policyholder's beneficiaries upon the policyholder's death. The policyholder pays premiums to the insurer in exchange for this financial protection.

The amount of money that the insurer pays out is known as the death benefit. The death benefit is typically determined by the policyholder when they take out the policy, and is usually based on the policyholder's age, health, and financial situation.

Life insurance policies can be either term life insurance or whole life insurance. Term life insurance policies are temporary and provide coverage for a set period of time, usually between one and 30 years. Whole life insurance policies are longer-term, and provide coverage for the policyholder's entire life.

Life insurance policies can also be either permanent or non-permanent. Permanent policies provide coverage for the policyholder's entire life, while non-permanent policies provide coverage for a set period of time.

In addition to providing financial protection to the policyholder's beneficiaries, life insurance policies can also be used as an investment. Many life insurance policies come with a cash value component, which the policyholder can use to invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other investments.

# History
Life insurance has been around since the early 1800s, when the first life insurance policies were issued in the United States. At the time, life insurance policies were used to provide financial protection to the policyholder's family in the event of their death.

In the early 1900s, the life insurance industry began to expand, with the introduction of new products such as whole life insurance and term life insurance. In the 1950s, the industry began to focus on providing additional benefits to policyholders, such as cash value components and investment options.

# Features

- Death benefit: The amount of money that the insurer pays out to the policyholder's beneficiaries upon their death.
- Premiums: The amount of money that the policyholder pays to the insurer in exchange for the death benefit.
- Cash value: A component of some life insurance policies that allows the policyholder to invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other investments.
