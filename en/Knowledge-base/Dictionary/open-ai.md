# Overview
Open AI is an artificial intelligence (AI) research laboratory founded by tech industry luminaries, including Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and Ilya Sutskever, amongst others. The lab’s mission is to advance artificial general intelligence (AGI) in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity. Open AI was funded by a combination of private donations and public grants.

# History
Open AI was founded in late 2015 with the goal of advancing AGI and creating beneficial technologies for humanity. Initial investors included such prominent figures as Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman, and Amazon Web Services. In January 2016, Open AI launched its first project, the Gym, a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

In February 2017, the lab made a major announcement – the release of the Open AI Universe platform. This platform allows developers to create and share AI agents that interact with a wide range of games and other applications.

In April 2018, Open AI announced its first commercial product, Open AI Five. This product is a team of five AI agents that are capable of playing the online game Dota 2 at a professional level. Open AI Five has since been used to study the development of collaboration between AI agents and to demonstrate the potential of machine learning.
