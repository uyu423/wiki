## Description
John von Neumann was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, and computer scientist who made major contributions to a variety of fields, including mathematics, quantum mechanics, game theory, computer science, and economics. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the development of modern computing.

Von Neumann was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1903 and studied mathematics at the University of Berlin. He made significant contributions to mathematics, including the development of the modern axiomatic approach to mathematics and the development of the theory of games. He also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, including the development of the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics.

Von Neumann's most significant contribution to computer science was the development of the stored-program computer, which revolutionized the field of computing. He also developed the Von Neumann architecture, which is the basis for modern computers. He also made important contributions to the development of computer languages, including the development of the FORTRAN programming language.

Von Neumann was also a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, and he developed the concept of self-replicating machines. He also made important contributions to the development of computer networks, including the development of the ARPANET.

## Life
John von Neumann was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1903. He was the eldest of three children born to a wealthy Jewish family. He attended the Lutheran Gymnasium in Budapest, where he excelled in mathematics and science. He then attended the University of Berlin, where he studied mathematics and physics.

Von Neumann was a brilliant student and was awarded his doctorate in mathematics in 1926. He then moved to the United States, where he taught at Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study. He also worked as a consultant for the US government, and he was involved in the development of the atomic bomb.

## Career
Von Neumann's career was marked by a series of groundbreaking contributions to mathematics, physics, and computer science. He made important contributions to the development of the modern axiomatic approach to mathematics, and he developed the theory of games. He also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, including the development of the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics.

## Relationships with Celebrities
Von Neumann was a close friend of Albert Einstein, and the two men often discussed their respective fields of research. He was also a close friend of the mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing, and the two men often discussed their respective fields of research.

## Quotations
Von Neumann was known for his wit and wisdom, and he often expressed his thoughts in memorable quotes. Some of his most famous quotes include:

- "The best way to predict the future is to create it."
- "In mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them."
- "The only useful thing in mathematics is the theorem."

## Criticism and Controversy
Von Neumann was criticized for his involvement in the development of the atomic bomb, and some have argued that his work was unethical. He was also criticized for his involvement in the development of the hydrogen bomb, which some have argued was a violation of international law.

## Digression
Von Neumann was an avid chess player, and he was known for his ability to solve complex chess problems. He was also an avid bridge player, and he wrote a book on the game.

## Others
Von Neumann was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. He was also a member of the Manhattan Project, and he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1956.
