# Software Development 023: TCP/IP and HTTP

The Internet is a network of computers that use the TCP/IP protocol to communicate with each other. TCP/IP is a set of rules that govern how computers can connect to each other and exchange data.

HTTP is a protocol that is used to transfer data over the Internet. It is the protocol that is used to request and retrieve web pages.

In this post, we will learn about the basics of TCP/IP and HTTP. We will learn about the structure of TCP/IP and how it works. We will also learn about the structure of HTTP and how it works.

## What is TCP/IP?

TCP/IP is a set of rules that govern how computers can connect to each other and exchange data. The name TCP/IP comes from the two main protocols that are used: TCP and IP.

TCP is a protocol that is used to transfer data between computers. It is a reliable protocol that ensures that data is delivered in the order that it was sent.

IP is a protocol that is used to route data between computers. It is an unreliable protocol that does not guarantee that data will be delivered in the order that it was sent.

## How does TCP/IP work?

TCP/IP works by using a four-layer model. The four layers are:

- The Application layer
- The Transport layer
- The Network layer
- The Link layer

The Application layer is the layer that applications use to communicate with each other. Examples of applications that use the Application layer are web browsers, email clients, and file transfer clients.

The Transport layer is the layer that is responsible for end-to-end communication. The Transport layer ensures that data is delivered reliably from one computer to another.

The Network layer is the layer that is responsible for routing data between computers. The Network layer uses IP to route data.

The Link layer is the layer that is responsible for physical communication. The Link layer uses Ethernet to physically connect computers.

## What is HTTP?

HTTP is a protocol that is used to transfer data over the Internet. It is the protocol that is used to request and retrieve web pages.

HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that each request is independent of the others. This makes HTTP a simple protocol to implement.

HTTP uses a request-response model. A client sends a request to a server, and the server responds with a response. The response contains the data that the client requested.

HTTP is a text-based protocol. This means that data is transferred as plain text. This makes HTTP easy to debug and to extend.
