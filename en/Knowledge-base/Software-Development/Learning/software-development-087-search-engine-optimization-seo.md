# Software Development 087: Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

The internet is a vast and ever-growing place. As more and more people and businesses come online, the competition to be seen and heard amongst the noise increases. Search engine optimization, or SEO, is the practice of improving the ranking of a website on search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo!. 

Good SEO can be the difference between a website that gets lost in the shuffle and a website that generates traffic and leads. In this post, we'll cover the basics of SEO and how to get started with optimizing your website.

## What is SEO?

SEO is the process of making a website more visible and attractive to search engines. The goal of SEO is to improve the visibility of a website so that it appears higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). 

There are two main types of SEO: on-page SEO and off-page SEO. On-page SEO refers to the optimization of a website's content and code. This includes things like optimizing title tags, meta tags, and anchor text. Off-page SEO refers to the optimization of a website's link profile. This includes things like link building and social media engagement. 

## Why is SEO important?

SEO is important because it can help a website to rank higher in search engine results pages. This, in turn, can lead to increased traffic and leads. 

## How to get started with SEO

There are a few things you can do to get started with SEO. First, you should make sure that your website's code is clean and well-organized. This will make it easier for search engines to index your website. Second, you should create high-quality, keyword-rich content. This will give you a better chance of ranking for your target keywords. Finally, you should build links to your website. This will help to improve your website's link profile and, as a result, your website's SEO.
