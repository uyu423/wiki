# Type Inference in Kotlin: Letting the Compiler Infer Types

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. It is fully interoperable with Java and can be used to develop Android apps.

One of the Kotlin's features is type inference, which allows the compiler to infer the types of variables and expressions. This can be helpful in reducing the amount of code that needs to be written.

## What is Type Inference?

Type inference is a feature of some programming languages that allows the compiler to infer the types of variables and expressions. This can be helpful in reducing the amount of code that needs to be written.

In Kotlin, type inference is used to infer the types of variables and expressions. The Kotlin compiler can infer the types of variables from the context in which they are used. For example, if a variable is assigned a value of type Int, the Kotlin compiler will infer that the variable is of type Int.

## How Does Type Inference Work?

Kotlin's type inference system is based on the Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm. This algorithm is used in many functional programming languages, such as Haskell and ML.

The Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm works by inferring the types of variables and expressions from the context in which they are used. For example, if a variable is assigned a value of type Int, the Kotlin compiler will infer that the variable is of type Int.

## What are the Benefits of Type Inference?

Type inference can be helpful in reducing the amount of code that needs to be written. It can also make code more readable by making the types of variables and expressions explicit.

## What are the Limitations of Type Inference?

Type inference can sometimes make code less readable by making the types of variables and expressions implicit. It can also make code more difficult to debug, since the types of variables and expressions are not always clear.

## How to Use Type Inference in Kotlin?

Kotlin's type inference system is based on the Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm. This algorithm is used in many functional programming languages, such as Haskell and ML.

The Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm works by inferring the types of variables and expressions from the context in which they are used. For example, if a variable is assigned a value of type Int, the Kotlin compiler will infer that the variable is of type Int.

To use type inference in Kotlin, simply declare variables without specifying their types. The Kotlin compiler will infer the types of the variables from the context in which they are used.

## Examples of Type Inference in Kotlin

Here are some examples of type inference in Kotlin:

```kotlin
// The Kotlin compiler will infer that the type of the variable is Int
val x = 1

// The Kotlin compiler will infer that the type of the variable is String
val y = "Hello, world!"

// The Kotlin compiler will infer that the type of the variable is List<Int>
val z = listOf(1, 2, 3)
```
